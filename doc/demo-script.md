## 1. (Individual 30-secoding pop pitches)
_Team members present their basic info, etc. [In what order?]_

## 2. (Demo lead talks about the problem):
When seeking help to solve a coding problem or learning a new technology, you soon realize that code snippets often don't exist in isolation, this is especially relevant for incoming developers who have difficulty in gathering all the bits and pieces of information scattered across the web. Even experts will often come up with generic or incomplete solutions when lacking adequate details and proper context.

There are also issues of beginners' fear of being the subject of hostile/destructive criticism.

## 3.(Hand off to Project Lead, who offers solution):
We offer a visually intuitive comparison with the original problem and the solution side-by-side, and including not just code snippet without a context but a comprehensive set of inter-dependent code modules that together highlight the issue of interest [[FEATURE: with cross-referenced and/or annotated sections of code that are proplematic]]

Our application is investigating ways to influence inter-personal barriers of entry and promote an environment of learning and exploration.

## 4. (Hand off to Tech-lead)
_[Tech lead talks about how exciting/innovative/bleeding-edge/etc the way we use Web technologies and APIs (React, very nice very modern, ooh, Websockets for chat [when implemented], etc...)._

## 5. (Hand off to Design-lead) 
_[Design lead talks about user stories (Beginner vs seasoned engineers)]

## 6. (Hand off to other members?)
_[Talk about what?]_
